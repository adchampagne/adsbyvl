            <li><b>Market Research</b><br>We start with studying your game and user’s motivations, your competitors, market trends</li>
            <li><b>Ideation </b><br>We assign a creative producer and team of designers who worked in similar projects who gather to brainstorm ideas for creatives. We base hypotheses on our research and explain why we think this scenario will perform</li>
            <li><b>Scenarios approval </b><br>After the scenarios are ready, we share them with you for your feedback. We can adapt your ideas and improve scenarios in this stage</li>
            <li><b>Production  </b><br>Our regular production time is 4 weeks. During this time we usually have one or two rounds of edits</li>
            <li><b>Edit Round  </b><br>After 2-3 weeks the first versions of videos are ready and it’s time for you to review them and give some feedback</li>
            <li><b>Post-analysis  </b><br>When you are done with the tests, it’s time for a post analysis. Our team checks the metrics and shares with you hypotheses - what didn’t work and what could be improved</li>
            <li><b>Next iteration  </b><br>Here we are entering a new phase of product scaling, where we have the numbers and stats for your game. We improve the ideas that performed 7 well and test new ideas to find your new top performer</li>
